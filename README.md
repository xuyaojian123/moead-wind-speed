# Cluster-based Short-term Wind Speed Interval Prediction with Multi-objective Ensemble Learning

this paper proposes a cluster-based short-term wind speed interval prediction with multi-objective ensemble learning. This method integrates uncertainties, extracted via clustering from the original time series, into the point prediction. Simultaneously, the point prediction methodology is enhanced by a multi-objective ensemble learning progress.
